### **Scenario**: A startup (TechCorp) wants to discuss a potential partnership with an investor (VentureCapital)

**What happens when you click "Start New NDA":**

### Step 1:
- The system presents you with pre-built clause options from a professional clause bank
- Think of it like a smart questionnaire that builds your NDA from scratch


### Step 2: Clause-by-Clause Decision Making

The system walks you through 5 key NDA decisions:

**Example - Step 1: "Nature of NDA"**

- **Question**: "Will both parties share confidential info, or just one?"
- **Your Options**:

1. **1st Choice**: "Standard Mutual" (both parties share secrets)
2. **2nd Choice**: "Flexible Mutual with Carveouts" (mutual but with exceptions)
3. **‚ùå Unacceptable**: "Unilateral Discloser-Only" (only one party protected)





**Example - Step 2: "Confidentiality Obligations"**

- **Question**: "How strict should the protection standard be?"
- **Your Ranking**:

1. **1st Choice**: "Strict Mutual (Enhanced Care)"
2. **2nd Choice**: "Mutual Balanced"
3. **‚ùå Unacceptable**: "Unilateral Recipient Obligations"




### Step 3: AI-Powered Matching

- The system compares YOUR preferences with the OTHER PARTY's preferences
- **Green ‚úÖ**: Both parties agree (use this clause)
- **Yellow üü°**: Different preferences but negotiable
- **Red üî¥**: Conflicting requirements (needs discussion)


### Step 4: Dynamic Document Generation

- The system automatically builds a complete NDA using the agreed clauses
- No manual document creation needed
- Professional legal formatting included


### **Real Business Value**:

Instead of lawyers spending hours drafting and negotiating, both parties complete their preferences in 10 minutes, and the AI instantly shows where they agree vs. need to negotiate.

The intake process replaces traditional document uploading with intelligent clause selection and automated conflict resolution.
